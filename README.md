# Work-Samples
Welcome to my Work Samples repositoryâ€”a curated collection of projects that showcase my expertise in data science, epidemiology, and statistical modeling. These samples reflect real-world applications of my skills across both public and private sectors, drawing from experiences at the CDC, academic research, and consulting work.
